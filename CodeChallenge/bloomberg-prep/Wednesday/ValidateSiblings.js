Check if two nodes in a Binary Tree are siblings
Given a binary tree and two nodes, the task is to check if the nodes are siblings of each other or not.

Two nodes are said to be siblings if they are present at the same level, and their parents are same.

Examples:

Input : 
       1
      /  \

   4   5 6  7
First node is 4 and Second node is 6.
Output : No, they are not siblings.

Input :
         1
        /  \
       5    6
