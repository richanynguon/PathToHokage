Problem Solving
1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and refractor

Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem (You may not be able to answer this quesiton until you set about solving the problem)

Explore concrete examples
Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better - examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should - ie. user stories / unit tests
1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid input

Break it Down
explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
this forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it - and it helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstanding before you dive in and have to worry about details 

Solve the problem
if you can't solve a simpler problem

Look back and refractor
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the results differently
- Can you understand it at a glance
- Can you use the results or method for some other problem
- Can you improve the performance of your solution
- Can you think of other ways to refractor
- How have other people solve this problem
