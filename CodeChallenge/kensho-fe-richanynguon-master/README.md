# Kensho Frontend Practical

This practical is designed to evaluate your ability to read and understand code,
as well as design and implement features in an unfamiliar codebase.

Please spend no more than 2 hours on this practical.

## Background

This application is a UI for viewing tabular data. The table currently supports
filtering by name, but it would be a lot more useful if you could filter based
on other columns or sort columns.

## Instructions

- Read and understand the code in this repo
- Add filtering for the missing data types
- Add sorting for the data types that make sense
- Document your approach in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)

The following libraries are included to aid in the development of your solution. Please do not use any other libraries in the application.

- [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/): A React-based UI toolkit for the web
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/): A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.

Don't worry too much about the UI/UX of your application. We will be evaluating the following pillars:

- Architecting features for ease of maintainability and readability.
- Ease of supporting additional features, e.g. larger datasets, additional columns, etc.
- Following good code standards.

## Deliverables

- Source code needed to run your challenge solution (commit to this repo)
- [A paragraph](./DESIGN.md) explaining what you focused on, your approach, your design, features you'd add if you had more time, etc.
