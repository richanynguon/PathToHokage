All Probability Formulas List in Maths
Probability Range:	0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
Rule of Addition:	P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)
Rule of Complementary Events:	P(A’) + P(A) = 1
Disjoint Events:	P(A∩B) = 0
Independent Events:	P(A∩B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B)
Conditional Probability:	P(A | B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)

Joint Probability: P(A∩B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B)
Indpendent Probability:  P = P(A|B) ⋅ P(C|D)

------
Bayes Formula:	P(A | B) = P(B | A) ⋅ P(A) / P(B)
