# Preprocessors 
A program that modifies data to conform with the input requirements of another program.
# Compiler   
A program that converts instructions into a machine code or lower-level form so they can be decode and executed by a computer.
# Assembler  
A program for converting instructions written in low level code into machine code 
# Linker   
Program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into one, executable program 
# Debug  
The process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software. 
# Tests   
There are different types of tests that can be done to make sure the program will hold up in the given condition.  

Types:
- Unit Testing
    - Focuses on the smallest unit
- Integration Testing
    - Testing a group of components together
    - Types
        - Top Down
        - Bottom Up
        - Sandwich
        - Big Bang
- Regression Testing
    - Make sure the component works as a whole properly
- Smoke Testing
    - Makes sure software is ready for further testing
- Alpha Testing
    - Validation Testing
- Beta Testing
    - User end performance
- System Testing
    - Test cross platform performance
- Stress Testing
    - Test unfavorable conditions to the systems
- Performance Testing
    - Test runtime performance

# Install   

Install the program onto the micro controller

# Other Aspects of Work Flow
## Software requirements  
---  

The software requirements are description of features and functionalities of the target systems.
   
## Environment Information  
---   
The enviroment information is a document that holds static variables.

## Software Build and Release  
---   
   
Software Build and Release refers to the specialized subfield of system administration that focuses on the process of building software from source code for the purpose of (initially) testing and (ultimately) releasing and distributing the software.

## Software review  
---   

A process or meeting during which a software product is examined by a project personnel, managers, users, customers, user representatives, or other interested parties for comment or approval

## Documentation  
---  

Software documentation is written text or illustration that accompanies computer software or is embedded in the source code
   
## Defect Tracking  
---   

The process of tracking the logged defects in a product from beginning to closure (by inspection, testing, or recording feedback from customers), and making new versions of the product that fix the defects
